# Toolpath_and_GCode_Generator

The present Mathematica notebook presents a toolpath and G-Code generator (designed to be used with BambuLab A1-Mini) based on signed distance field (SDFs) and clustering algorithms.

As a demonstration case, please, run the available code "SignedDistanceFunctions" with the "Test.stl" file in the same directory. The user can fine tune the parameters in the Mathematica notebook to obtain the best possible results according to your requirements.

If you use the code for your work, please, cite it as
